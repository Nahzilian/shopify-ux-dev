## Overall:
### Requirements:
- Feartures are built around the given requirement, however, I have replaced the button with on-click features (Directly click on cards)
- The webpage can also save user's selected movies (up to 5 MB of data since I used localStorage, however, there will be no distribution over multiple value in localStorage).
